## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I am a PhD student at the Groningen Insitute for Evolutionary Life Sciences (GELIFES) at the **University of Groningen**, the Netherlands. 

During my PhD I have been working with longitudinal, whole-genome DNA methylation data from two avian species, the zebra finch (*Taeniopygia guttata*) and the jackdaw (*Corvus monedula*). This has provided me with the unique opportunity to study how epigenetic plasticity shapes adult phenotypes and contriibutes to sex-dependent aging and longevity. 

I am passionate about bioinformatics, (epi)genomics, and aging research. I thrive on collaboration and am always eager to learn new skills and contribute to innovative projects.
